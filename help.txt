Telegram WC help:

TelegramWordCloud is a simple tool that can extract the most common words in a Telegram channel and analyse them into a Word
Cloud. It supports loading your own CSV exports or logging in with Telethon to pull channel history directly.


<<<Features>>>
[] Stopword removal - filter filler words such as "the", "and", and "be" to highlight topic words.
[] Russian/Ukrainian language support - extra stopwords can be added to stopwords.txt if required.
[] Two source options - process an existing CSV/JSON export *or* authenticate with Telethon and download a channel on demand.
[] Shows and saves the output - the generated word cloud can be displayed and optionally written to disk.
[] Processing options - toggle whether the image is saved, enable download-only mode, and (for Telethon) download all posts, a date range, or the last N posts.
[] Optional credential storage - save your API ID/hash and phone to a `.env` file so the GUI pre-populates them on next launch.
[] Preview shortcuts - right-click the live preview to copy the image to the clipboard (Windows) or save it via “Save image as...”.
[] Download progress - when fetching a channel via Telethon, the status bar shows processed messages vs. the estimated total (based on the latest post ID).


<<<Loading a CSV or JSON export>>>
1. Choose **Load CSV export** in the GUI.
2. Select the source type:
   - **CSV export** – point to any Telegram CSV file (it no longer needs to live in the project folder).
   - **Telegram JSON (result.json)** – point directly to the JSON that Telegram Desktop creates. The parser flattens mixed text/list entries automatically.
3. Specify where you would like the image (or downloaded messages) to be saved in the *Output* section.
4. Adjust the processing options (save image or preview only).
5. Press **Run**.

To create a CSV export:
- Use Telegram Desktop to export a channel as JSON and convert it with a tool such as SaveJSON2CSV, or export as CSV directly on Linux.
- Deselect media when exporting unless you specifically need it.


<<<Downloading via Telethon>>>
1. Choose **Download via Telethon**.
2. Fill in your Telegram API ID and API hash (get them from https://my.telegram.org).
3. Enter the phone number tied to that API as `+<countrycode><number>`.
4. Click **Send login code**. Telegram will send you an SMS; enter the code in the popup (you can also press **Enter verification code** later or wait for the automatic prompt when running the download). The API hash entry is hidden for privacy.
5. Provide the public channel username (with or without `@`) or an invite link.
6. Choose whether to download everything, a specific date range, or only the last N posts. Decide whether you want to save the word cloud or tick **Download channel messages only** to export the raw messages.
7. Press **Run**. If you have two-factor authentication enabled you will be prompted inside the GUI for your password.

Notes:
- The Telethon option requires `pip install telethon`.
- Sessions are stored locally under `telegramwordcloud_session`, so you only need the SMS code once per account. The authentication status line in the Telethon section turns green when a session is active, orange when a login is required, and red when an error occurs. Use **Check authentication** at any time to refresh the status.
- You must be able to view the channel you request (join it first if it is private).


<<<Credential storage>>>
- Click **Save credentials to .env** in the Telethon section to store your API ID, API hash, and phone number locally.
- On startup TelegramWordCloud looks for `.env` in the project folder. If it exists, the GUI fills in the API/phone fields automatically, but you can still edit them before authenticating.
- The `.env` file lives beside `main.py`. Keep it out of source control if you plan to share the project.


<<<Processing options>>>
- **Save wordcloud image** (checked by default) controls whether a JPEG is written to the output folder after each run. Uncheck it to only preview the cloud on screen.
- **Download channel messages only (Telethon mode)** skips the word cloud entirely, downloads the selected channel, and saves it as a CSV for later processing.


<<<Download-only exports>>>
When the download-only option is enabled, TelegramWordCloud writes the retrieved messages (and any generated wordclouds) inside `exports/<channel>/<timestamp>/` under your chosen output directory. The CSV includes message IDs, dates, sender IDs, and the text column so it can be fed back into the tool or used elsewhere.


<<<Editing the stopwords list>>>
Stopwords are words that you don't want to include in the word cloud. They live in `stopwords.txt`. Add one term per line for every language or recurring token you want filtered out (e.g. "YouTube", "https", usernames, etc).


<<<Troubleshooting>>>
- "Telethon is required..." → install it via `pip install telethon`.
- "No text messages were found" → ensure you selected the correct CSV or that the channel actually has text messages (for Telethon exports, try the download-only option to verify data is being saved).
- "Unable to access that channel" → verify the username/link and that your account has joined the channel.
- All status updates and errors are written to `telegramwordcloud.log` in the project folder for later review.
