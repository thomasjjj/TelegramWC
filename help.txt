Telegram WC help:

TelegramWC
TelegramWC is a simple tool that can extract the most common words in a Telegram channel export and analyse them into a
Word Cloud. This can be used to get an initial idea of the topics and content within the channel. It could also be used
as part of a larger Telegram analysis tool.


<<<Features>>>
[]Stopword removal - this allows the most common words such as "the", "and", and "be"
                     to be ommited from the output which increases the relevance of
                     topic words and adjectives.
[]Russian/Ukrainian language support - this includes a many stopwords for Russian and
                    a few for Ukrainian but can be increased by editing the stopwords.txt
                    file.
[]Shows and saves the output - Allows you to have a saved image from the process.


<<<Creating a dataset>>>
Export a Telegram channel of your choice as JSON or CSV (Linux only). I recommend deselecting all the media and only
keeping the text to avoid downloading extreme or illegal materials.

Convert the output result.json to CSV for processing. I recommend using the SaveJSON2CSV tool which works very well
with Telegram export data.

Place the resulting CSV into the project directory. Make sure it is named "result.csv".


<<<Editing the stopwords list>>>
Stopwords are words that you don't want to include in the word cloud. These are normally the "filler" words that are
used to construct a sentence but may be useless in themselves.

The list of stopwords is present in the stopwords.txt file. It currently supports English, Russian, and some Ukrainian.
More can be added depending on the language and use case.

For example, if there is a channel that regularly links to YouTube but that is irrelevant, you can add "YouTube" to the
stopwords file.
